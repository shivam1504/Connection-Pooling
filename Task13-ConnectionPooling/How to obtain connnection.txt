To obtain a connection from a data source, do the following:

Procedure To Connect to a Data Source

Steps
1.Obtain the initial JNDI context.

  To guarantee portability between different environments,  
  the code used to retrieve an InitialContext object (in a servlet, in a JSP page, or an EJB) is as follows:

InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();

2.Use a JNDI lookup to obtain a data source reference.

  To obtain a reference to a data source bound to the JNDI context, 
  look up the data source’s JNDI name from the initial context object. 
  The object retrieved in this way is cast as a DataSource type object:

ds = (DataSource)ctx.lookup(JndiDataSourceName);

3.Use the data source reference to obtain the connection.

  This operation requires the following line of code:

conn = ds.getConnection();
